# API for Sending Emails

## Description

Who has never sent an email?, nowadays if you ask this question to a hundred people I find it difficult for anyone to respond with a no, perhaps people who have not had access to technology, or your grandfather, grandmother, perhaps even your parents, for age account, but even so, I find it difficult that they haven't accessed their gmail or outlook to see if they received any email about their retirement or from the bank itself.

Having an Email is essential for anyone who wants to have a digital life, it is your mailbox in your digital home, and today we can do this magical sending through a package called nodemailer through our APIs, and that is the focus of this API , have this delivery in a more complete way.
